% Mining activity was and is always connected with the occurrence of dangers which are commonly called
% mining hazards. A special case of such threat is a seismic hazard which frequently occurs in many
% underground mines. Seismic hazard is the hardest detectable and predictable of natural hazards and in
% this respect it is comparable to an earthquake. More and more advanced seismic and seismoacoustic
% monitoring systems allow a better understanding rock mass processes and definition of seismic hazard
% prediction methods. Accuracy of so far created methods is however far from perfect. Complexity of
% seismic processes and big disproportion between the number of low-energy seismic events and the number
% of high-energy phenomena (e.g. > 10^4J) causes the statistical techniques to be insufficient to predict
% seismic hazard. Therefore, it is essential to search for new opportunities of better hazard prediction,
% also using machine learning methods. In seismic hazard assessment data clustering techniques can be
% applied (Lesniak A., Isakow Z.: Space-time clustering of seismic events and hazard assessment in the
% Zabrze-Bielszowice coal mine, Poland. Int. Journal of Rock Mechanics and Mining Sciences, 46(5), 2009,
% 918-928), and for prediction of seismic tremors artificial neural networks are used (Kabiesz, J.: Effect
% of the form of data on the quality of mine tremors hazard forecasting using neural networks.
% Geotechnical and Geological Engineering, 24(5), 2005, 1131-1147). In the majority of applications, the
% results obtained by mentioned methods are reported in the form of two states which are interpreted as
% "hazardous" and "non-hazardous". Unbalanced distribution of positive ("hazardous state") and negative
% ("non-hazardous state") examples is a serious problem in seismic hazard prediction. Currently used
% methods are still insufficient to achieve good sensitivity and specificity of predictions. In the paper
% (Bukowska M.: The probability of rockburst occurrence in the Upper Silesian Coal Basin area dependent on
% natural mining conditions. Journal of Mining Sciences, 42(6), 2006, 570-577) a number of factors having
% an effect on seismic hazard occurrence was proposed, among other factors, the occurrence of tremors with
% energy > 10^4J was listed. The task of seismic prediction can be defined in different ways, but the main
% aim of all seismic hazard assessment methods is to predict (with given precision relating to time and
% date) of increased seismic activity which can cause a rockburst. In the data set each row contains a
% summary statement about seismic activity in the rock mass within one shift (8 hours). If decision
% attribute has the value 1, then in the next shift any seismic bump with an energy higher than 10^4 J was
% registered. That task of hazards prediction bases on the relationship between the energy of recorded
% tremors and seismoacoustic activity with the possibility of rockburst occurrence. Hence, such hazard
% prognosis is not connected with accurate rockburst prediction. Moreover, with the information about the
% possibility of hazardous situation occurrence, an appropriate supervision service can reduce a risk of
% rockburst (e.g. by distressing shooting) or withdraw workers from the threatened area. Good prediction
% of increased seismic activity is therefore a matter of great practical importance.   The presented data
% set is characterized by unbalanced distribution of positive and negative examples. In the data set there
% are only 170 positive examples representing class 1.
